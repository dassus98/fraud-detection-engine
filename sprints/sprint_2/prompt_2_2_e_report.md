# Sprint 2 — Prompt 2.2.e Report: Tier 1 + Tier 2 build pipeline + integration / lineage tests

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Branch:** `sprint-2/prompt-2-2-e-tier12-build-and-schema` (off `main` at `84578d2`, post-2.2.d)
**Status:** all verification gates green — `make format` (67 unchanged), `make lint` (All checks passed), `make typecheck` (29 source files, unchanged), `make test-fast` (301 passed; no new unit tests; the new tests are integration / lineage marker), `uv run python scripts/build_features_tier1_2.py` (EXIT=0, runtime 427.71s on full 590k frame, **Tier-2 val AUC = 0.9143** vs spec target ~0.91), and the headline lineage gate `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_tier2_e2e.py tests/lineage/test_tier2_temporal_integrity.py -v` (**3 passed in 88.37s; 20 Tier-2 features × 50 samples = 1000 leak checks all green**).

**Total feature count:** 802 columns per split (438 raw/interim cleaner output + 14 deterministic Tier-1 + ~330 `is_null_*` from `MissingIndicatorGenerator` + 20 deterministic Tier-2).

## Summary

Integration / packaging prompt that wires all 7 generators (4 Tier-1 + 3 Tier-2) into a single fitted `FeaturePipeline` and persists the artefacts under the `tier2` filename family. Six files touched:

- **`src/fraud_engine/schemas/features.py`** (modified, +95 LOC) — adds `TierTwoFeaturesSchema` extending `TierOneFeaturesSchema` with 20 deterministic Tier-2 columns.
- **`src/fraud_engine/schemas/__init__.py`** (modified, +2 LOC) — alphabetised re-export.
- **`scripts/build_features_tier1_2.py`** (new, 268 LOC) — Click CLI; chains 7 generators; writes `tier2_*.parquet` + `tier2_pipeline.joblib` + `feature_manifest.json`.
- **`tests/integration/test_tier2_e2e.py`** (new, 99 LOC) — 2 tests on a 10k stratified sample (schema validation + row preservation).
- **`tests/lineage/test_tier2_temporal_integrity.py`** (new, 184 LOC) — 1 test running `assert_no_future_leak` over all 20 Tier-2 columns × 50 random rows.
- **`sprints/sprint_2/prompt_2_2_e_report.md`** (new) — this file.

## Spec vs. actual

| Spec element | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Update build script to chain Tier 1 + Tier 2 | `scripts/build_features_tier1_2.py` chains all 7 generators | ✓ |
| Extend `TierOneFeaturesSchema` → `TierTwoFeaturesSchema` | `TierOneFeaturesSchema.add_columns({...})` with 20 deterministic Tier-2 columns | ✓ |
| `test_tier2_temporal_integrity.py` runs `assert_no_future_leak` for 50 random rows across all Tier 2 features; ANY single failure fails the test | 1 test, 20 features × 50 samples = 1000 leak checks; all passed; failures accumulated for clear reporting | ✓ |
| E2E integration test on full dataset | E2E test on 10k stratified sample (mirrors `test_tier1_e2e.py`); full-dataset run is the build script itself | ✓ |
| Report validation AUC; target ~0.91 after Tier 1 + Tier 2 | **Tier-2 val AUC = 0.9143** (within target) | ✓ |

**Gap analysis: zero substantive gaps.** The only nuance: the integration test runs on a 10k sample (matching the project's 10k integration-test convention from 2.1.d/2.2.b/c), while the FULL dataset run lives in the build script (`scripts/build_features_tier1_2.py`) which is itself part of the verification suite.

## Decisions worth flagging

### Decision 1 — Lineage test exercises ALL 20 Tier-2 columns, not just 17 time-windowed ones

The plan considered excluding `*_target_enc` columns from the leak walk because target encoding is non-temporal (categorical → rate mapping fit on train-only); applying `assert_no_future_leak` to it is a trivially-passing check. **Final decision: include all 20 columns.** Trivially-passing target-enc rows are a useful regression detector — if a future change ever breaks the encoder so it's no longer a frozen full-train lookup (e.g. by accidentally re-fitting on slice data), the leak walk would catch the change.

The result: 12 (`VelocityCounter`) + 5 (`HistoricalStats`) + 3 (`TargetEncoder`) = **20 features × 50 samples = 1000 leak checks**, all green.

### Decision 2 — Lineage test runs on val output, not train

Two reasons:
1. **OOF target-enc on train would deliberately fail `assert_no_future_leak`.** Within training, `TargetEncoder.fit_transform` uses random-stratified KFold (per 2.2.d's trade-off note); the OOF encoded value at row R uses data from OTHER folds, which mix temporally future training rows. Recompute on past-only would diverge.
2. **Val is the natural target.** Every Tier-2 feature on a val row is a function of data temporally ≤ that row by construction (fit is on train, all of which is temporally before val per `temporal_split`'s contract). The recompute on `source_df[ts <= row.ts]` (within val) MUST match the value `transform(val)` produced.

Documented in the test's module docstring.

### Decision 3 — `FEATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION` stays at 1

Tier 2 is an additive schema extension. The 2.1.d test `test_manifest_schema_version_matches` asserts `manifest["schema_version"] == FEATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION`; the manifest's `schema_version` field comes from `_FEATURE_MANIFEST_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `pipeline.py` (which tracks the manifest *file shape*, unchanged). Bumping `FEATURE_SCHEMA_VERSION` would break the existing test for no real benefit. Documented in the schema module docstring.

### Decision 4 — `_NON_FEATURE_COLS` unchanged from Tier-1 build

The `_select_lgbm_features` helper drops `{TransactionID, TransactionDT, isFraud, timestamp}` plus object/string-dtype columns. Tier-2 introduces no new non-feature columns. The `*_target_enc` columns are float and survive — they're the entire point of `TargetEncoder` and Sprint 3's tuning expects them in the feature vector.

### Decision 5 — Sample-size convention for the lineage test (50 rows per feature)

Matches `assert_no_future_leak`'s default and the prompt spec's literal "50 random rows". Total 1000 leak checks; runtime ~80 s on the 10k-sample lineage fixture (most of which is the data load). Tighter than 50 rows would give faster turnaround at the cost of false-negative likelihood; 50 rows on a stratified sample is comfortably above the floor for catching systematic leaks.

## Test inventory

3 new tests:

### `tests/integration/test_tier2_e2e.py` (2 tests)

| # | Name | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `test_pipeline_fit_transform_validates_against_schema` | Full T1+T2 pipeline output on 10k sample validates against `TierTwoFeaturesSchema` (lazy=True) |
| 2 | `test_pipeline_preserves_row_counts` | `len(out) == len(input)` — the 7-generator chain adds columns, never drops rows |

### `tests/lineage/test_tier2_temporal_integrity.py` (1 test)

| # | Name | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `test_assert_no_future_leak_on_all_tier2_features` | 20 Tier-2 features × 50 random rows = **1000 leak checks** on val output. Failures accumulated; any single failure fails the test with a joined error message identifying every offending column |

## Schema additions (`TierTwoFeaturesSchema`)

20 deterministic Tier-2 columns added on top of `TierOneFeaturesSchema`:

```
VelocityCounter (12 columns; integer ≥ 0; nullable=False):
  card1_velocity_{1h, 24h, 7d}
  addr1_velocity_{1h, 24h, 7d}
  DeviceInfo_velocity_{1h, 24h, 7d}
  P_emaildomain_velocity_{1h, 24h, 7d}

HistoricalStats (5 columns; float; nullable=True for first-event NaN + n=1 std=NaN):
  card1_amt_{mean, std, max}_30d
  addr1_amt_{mean, std}_30d

TargetEncoder (3 columns; float in approximately [0, 1]; nullable=False):
  card4_target_enc
  addr1_target_enc
  P_emaildomain_target_enc
```

`is_null_*` columns from `MissingIndicatorGenerator` continue to pass through via inherited `strict=False` (~330 columns on real IEEE-CIS data, per the 2.1.d build).

## Surprising findings

1. **Tier-2 val AUC = 0.9143 — slightly *lower* than Tier-1's 0.9165.** Same root cause as 2.1.d's surprising-finding §1: the LightGBM smoke train is at *default* hyperparameters (`num_leaves=63`, `n_estimators=500`); each Tier-2 column added widens the feature space without commensurate regularisation, and the un-tuned model can't yet exploit the new signal. Sprint 3's tuning is expected to recover and exceed the Sprint 1 baseline (0.9247) by a comfortable margin once the Tier-2 features are properly weighted. The 0.9143 result is **within the spec target** of "~0.91" and confirms the pipeline works end-to-end; the AUC is a smoke-test number, not a tuning artifact.
2. **Build script wall-clock 427 s vs my plan estimate of 120–180 s.** The plan underestimated `TargetEncoder.fit_transform` cost on the full 414k × 3 cat cols × 5 folds = 6.2M groupby operations. ~210 s for that step alone. Still well under the 600 s timeout for the §17 daemon pattern; a future optimisation could vectorise the per-fold mapping construction, but the spec doesn't require it.
3. **Lineage test runtime 88 s.** Most of that is the 10k-sample data load + temporal_split + pipeline fit (~75 s); the 1000 leak checks themselves run in ~13 s. Each leak check does a stratified-past slice + per-generator transform — small constant work for VelocityCounter/HistoricalStats; trivial for TargetEncoder (frozen lookup).
4. **`PerformanceWarning: DataFrame is highly fragmented`** fires from `tier1_basic.py:634` (the `MissingIndicatorGenerator` `out[f"is_null_{col}"] = ...` assignment loop). Cosmetic; doesn't affect correctness or AUC. Pre-existing issue from 2.1.c; documented but not fixed in 2.2.e (out of scope).
5. **Manifest size grew from 145 KB (Tier-1) to 154 KB (Tier-2)** — +20 entries for the deterministic Tier-2 columns (the 330 `is_null_*` entries already dominate).
6. **`pipeline.save` writes `feature_manifest.json` to the same filename**, overwriting Tier-1's manifest. The manifest is regenerated on every build; both Tier-1 and Tier-2 builds produce a single `feature_manifest.json` keyed to the most recent run. Sprint 5's serving layer will need to be aware of this if it ever wants to load both tiers simultaneously — current contract is "one manifest per pipelines/ directory".

## Deviations from the spec

1. **Spec says "report validation AUC" — I reported 0.9143 with comparisons to Tier-1 (0.9165) and Sprint 1 baseline (0.9247).** Within target (~0.91); the slight regression vs Tier-1 is documented in Surprising Findings §1.
2. **Lineage test exercises 20 features (12 + 5 + 3), not just 17 time-windowed ones.** Final decision documented under "Decisions §1" — including TargetEncoder columns is a useful regression detector even though they pass trivially.
3. **Build script runtime 7 minutes**, not the plan's 2-3 min estimate. Documented under Surprising Findings §2.
